Build a fully working AI-powered study assistant web app called PrepMate for university-level students.
The app must have clear page navigation, saved state, and deterministic actions so users always move forward correctly.

🔁 GLOBAL APP RULES (IMPORTANT)

Student data must be saved once and reused across pages
Each button must trigger a specific action + page navigation
The quiz must always progress → results → schedule
Do NOT leave any actions as placeholders
Do NOT rely on user typing commands to navigate

1️⃣ Student Info Page (START PAGE)
Create the first screen with a form containing:
Student Name (text)
Subject (text or dropdown)
Exam Date (date picker)
Daily Study Time (dropdown: 30 / 45 / 60 minutes)

Button:
“Save & Start Quiz”
Button Action (MANDATORY):
Save all form data to app state
Initialize quiz state:
currentQuestion = 1
totalQuestions = 5
weakTopics = empty list
correctAnswers = 0

Navigate automatically to Quiz Page

⚠️ The app must NOT remain on this page after clicking the button.

2️⃣ Quiz Page (AI-Driven)
Quiz Rules:
Ask exactly 5 university-level questions
Show one question at a time
Display progress indicator: “Question X of 5”
Subject Logic:
Math → Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability, Discrete Math
IT / Computer Science → Algorithms, Data Structures, Logic, Databases

After Each Answer:
AI evaluates the answer

Show:
